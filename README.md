# Assignment_3_Resubmission
Course: Collecting Data | Student Number: S6494935

The webpage that I originally handed in for Assignment 3 was the [U.S. topic on Google News](https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqIggKIhxDQkFTRHdvSkwyMHZNRGxqTjNjd0VnSmxiaWdBUAE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen). However, as is visible on the [Commits webpage](https://github.com/Cameron-Meinsma/Assignment_3/commits/main/) of that repository, I originally tried to scrape the Dutch women's field hockey team webpage. While I did not manage to figure it out before the Assignment 3 deadline and thus had to change course and scrape Google News instead, I did manage to do it this time around. I know that I am taking a risk by scraping a different website, considering the fact that I did receive positive feedback on Assignment 3. However, I believe that this project showcases my skills way more than Assignment 3 did. To elaborate, I believe that I followed the Selenium notebook too much during Assignment 3, whereas for this project, I had to truly rely on my own skills to figure it out.
