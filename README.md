# Assignment_3_Resubmission
Course: Collecting Data | Student Number: S6494935

The webpage that I originally handed in for Assignment 3 was the [U.S. topic on Google News](https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqIggKIhxDQkFTRHdvSkwyMHZNRGxqTjNjd0VnSmxiaWdBUAE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen). However, as is visible on the [Commits tab](https://github.com/Cameron-Meinsma/Assignment_3/commits/main/) of that repository, I originally tried to scrape the [Dutch Women's Outdoor Field Hockey National Team's webpage](https://www.fih.hockey/outdoor-rankings/netherlands-women-hockey-rankings-48) on the [International Hockey Federation (FIH) website](https://www.fih.hockey/). While I did not manage to figure it out before the Assignment 3 deadline and thus had to change course and scrape Google News instead, I did manage to do it this time around. Therefore, I have decided to switch from the U.S. topic on Google News to the Dutch women's field hockey team webpage. Moreover, I believe that the FIH website highlights my skills more, due to the structure of the website being completely different from the Selenium scraping notebook. To elaborate, the notebook consists of the scraping of the [Ground News](https://ground.news/) website, which is a news website. Therefore, during the original submission I was able to simply follow the steps in the notebook for the most part, without having to figure out too much on my own. The Dutch women's field hockey team webpage however, consists of a dynamic table where one can select a specific year from a dropdown menu for the values in the table to change, and where one can click on a row to expand it and see more information.
