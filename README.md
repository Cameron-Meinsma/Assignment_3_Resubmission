# Assignment_3_Resubmission
Course: Collecting Data | Student Number: S6494935

The webpage that I originally handed in for Assignment 3 was the [U.S. topic on Google News](https://news.google.com/topics/CAAqIggKIhxDQkFTRHdvSkwyMHZNRGxqTjNjd0VnSmxiaWdBUAE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen). However, as is visible on the [Commits webpage](https://github.com/Cameron-Meinsma/Assignment_3/commits/main/) of that repository, I originally tried to scrape the Dutch women's field hockey team webpage. While I did not manage to figure it out before the Assignment 3 deadline and thus had to change course and scrape Google News instead, I did manage to do it this time around. Therefore, I have decided to switch from the U.S. topic on Google News to the [Dutch Women's Outdoor Field Hockey National Team's webpage](https://www.fih.hockey/outdoor-rankings/netherlands-women-hockey-rankings-48) on the [International Hockey Federation website](https://www.fih.hockey/)
